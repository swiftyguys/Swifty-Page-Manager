Manage your WordPress pages. Like a boss.

== Description ==

**Swifty Page Manager**  
*MANAGE YOUR WORDPRESS PAGES. LIKE A BOSS.*
 
WordPress handles the pages of your website like blog posts. You can order them alphabetically, by date, by author or by number of responses. Nice for blog posts. Not so much for website pages. Swifty Page Manager shows you how the pages of your WordPress site are positioned and related to each other in a clear page tree overview.
 
**Add. Move. Remove.**   
*MAKE SENSE OF YOUR WORDPRESS PAGES AGAIN.*
 
Add a new page and drag-and-drop it in the right position. Need to delete a page? Just click the trash bin icon and you’re done. Made a mistake? No worries. You can always get it back from the trash bin.
 
**Basic page settings**   
*EASY ACCESS TO WHAT YOU NEED MOST*
 
When you add a page, just give it a short name. This will appear in the main navigation menu of your site. Then give it a title. That’s the short line of text that will appear blue in Google. Very important to put the main keyword in there.
 
**Advanced page settings**   
*SOME EXTRA’S. WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.*
 
Neatly tucked away behind the “More” button you will find things like the page URL. It is generated automatically. But if you want, you can change the so called 'slug' here. And you can change the status from draft to published and back.
 
**Super powers within reach**   
*UNLOCK THE FULL BENEFITS OF ALL SWIFTY PLUGINS WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER*

*Swifty Page Manager is part of the SwiftySite family of plugins and theme. Designed specifically for the end-user, wether you're plumber or a painter, a shop owner or a consultant, a secretary of a law firm asked to maintain the website or a soccer mom who volunteered to manage the club website, SwiftySite will simplify creating and managing a WordPress website for you like no other. Search for the [SwiftySite plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/swifty-site/) and get all of this awesomeness today. For free.*

Having said that, here are the benefits of the Swifty Page Manager when you use it as part of the whole SwiftySite experience:
 
**Built-in navigation**   
*YOUR PAGE-TREE IS YOUR SITE’S NAVIGATION MENU*
 
Normally in WP you create pages in one spot. And then define the menu somewhere else. Mistakes are easily made. It’s easy to forget to add a new page to the site menu. But not with Swifty Page Manager. Because Swifty Site Designer makes sure your site menu is exactly what your page tree overview looks like.
 
**Now you see me.**   
**Now you don’t.**   
*SHOW OR HIDE A PAGE IN THE NAVIGATION MENU.*
 
Swifty Page Manager works closely together with the Swifty Site Designer theme. That enables you to create a page for the whole world to see. But also to hide that page from your menu. This is especially helpful for landing pages. You know, when you advertise on facebook or Google and you want the people to ‘land’ on a special page.
 
**Touch-friendly navigation**   
*OPTIMIZED SITE MENU FOR MOBILE DEVICES.*
 
There is a special interaction between Swifty Page Manager and the Swifty Site Designer Theme. If you have both, you can decide how your menu should behave. On mobile, one tap on a main menu item opens the submenu. Lot’s of visitors don’t realize they have to tap the main menu item again if they want to go there. This could potentially mean that one of your most important pages does not get the number of visitors it deserves. We solve this problem by adding an extra button at the top of the submenu. This button has the same name as the main menu item by default. And on click goes there. In the Page Manager, however, you can change the name of this button.
 
**Area management**   
*CREATE YOUR OWN PAGE TYPES*
 
There is also a special interaction between Swifty Page Manager and the [Swifty Content Creator Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/swifty-content-creator/). If you have both, you can decide – per page – which area’s of that page, such as the header, the footer or the navigation bar, need to be shown or hidden. This allows you to create special types of pages. Like a landing page. A blog page. Or a product page.
 
**Copy-paste**   
*CREATE THE PERFECT PAGE. THEN RE-USE IT AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE.*
 
A huge time saver is the ability to make a copy of an entire page. For certain parts of your site, like your blog or your product pages, you may want to use the same type of page layout every time. Just create it once. And then re-use it for the next one. Told ya. Super powers are up for grabs ;-)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between 'Draft' and 'Live' ? =

Draft is beer from the tap and Live is ... :-)

In the page settings you can choose between 'Draft' and 'Live'. When you select 'Live' the page will be visible for the visitors of your site. When you select 'Draft', the page will not be visible on your website nor in your menu. This is great if you are making a new page which is not final yet or if you temporarily want to take a page offline. When you are ready, you can change the page settings to 'live'.

= Oops...I deleted the wrong page. What should I do? =

Well, good thing we didn't take out the trash yet!

All the removed pages have been put into the trash bin. You can access the trash bin by clicking the 'Trash' link located above your page tree. You can then select the deleted items and restore them if you wish. Or you can choose to remove them permanently.

= In the page settings I can choose between some different templates. What does this mean? =

It means that your website theme is so awesome that it has several predefined page templates that you can choose from. These templates are specific pagetypes such as a contact-page, blog-page, archive-page or FAQ-page. You can choose these here and save yourself some time setting up the page content.

= How can I re-arrange my page tree? =

You can easily re-arrange your pages by dragging them up or down to another position in the page tree. If you see a check icon, you can release your mouse button to move the page to this specific spot. If the arrow points at a page, the page you are moving will become a sub page of that page. If the arrow points between two pages it will become a page on that level and in that position.

**Tip**: to re-arrange your Christmas tree, see below

= This plugin is awesome! How can I thank you? =

First of all, thanks for using our plugin. We really appreciate that. If you want to thank us, you can give us a nice rating in the side bar here. This helps others make an informed decision. Also, you might tell a few of your friends about us. :-)

= How can I re-arrange my Christmas tree? =

If you have one of those perfectly shaped fake trees, you should look for color-coded branches and put them in in the right order. If you have a real tree, well, the fake tree stores might still be open...

Next, put in the lights. Lots of lights! Step back, squeeze your eyes a bit and look at the tree through your eyelashes. This way you can check if the lights are distributed proparly. Same goes for all the other decorations.

If you put candy in your tree, make sure you put it low enough so that the kids can reach it. If you put it out of reach, they WILL find a way to get it. And most of the time it ends badly for the tree!
